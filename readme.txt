== Description ==
This plugin adds the latest MooTools Javascript framework to your site. Use this plugin if you write code/scripts that require MooTools, or if you prefer to work with MooTools rather than jQuery.

This library contains both the full MooTools Core 1.3.2 (with MooTools 1.2 compatibility) and the full MooTools More 1.3.2.1 libraries!  The file is compressed/packed using Dean Edwards' Packer into ONE SINGLE FILE.

When the next stable public version of MooTools is released, we will update this plugin to contain the next recent version.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `mootools-complete` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

You'll notice all pages in your Wordpress site will have the "mootools.js" file included. This file will NOT be included to your Admin pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q. Many MooTools Wordpress plugins aren't maintained. Will this be any different?
A. Fortunately, this library will be maintained meticulously seeing that the author uses MooTools in his daily life and will require updates for his own personal development projects.
